# toehold

Code challenge for job candidates. core.clj contains a basic tic tac toe
simulation, with one key function left unimplemented. tree.clj is a namespace
for representing a tree of all possible tic tac toe games. Both files contain
;; CHALLENGE comments. See also tests in test/toehold.

There's no expectation that you finish all challenges. We suggest limiting
yourself to a few hours of effort. We do also realize that this is testing for
CS-theory sort of stuff more than for all the surrounding skills (deployment,
library skills, etc), but this was the best we came up with for a tractable
challenge.
